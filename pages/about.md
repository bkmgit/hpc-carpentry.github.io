**Vision:** Our vision is to be the leading inclusive community teaching data and coding skills for HPC resources.

**Mission:** We're still working on our mission statement, but when it lands it's going to be amazing!

HPC Carpentry operates in the spirit of [The Carpentries](https://carpentries.org/) but we are **not** (currently)
an official program of The Carpentries. We do try to inherit some of the best practices and effort of The
Carpentries, which is clearly reflected in things like our [Code of Conduct](/code-of-conduct) (and how we
created this website!).
