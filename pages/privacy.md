Currently, we do not _require_ any sensitive personally identifiable information: providing
names of instructors & helpers is optional when
[registering your workshop](/register_workshop/) and we
deliberately do not collect email or social media handles. If you do provide this
information, we try to make it clear that the information you submit will be made publicly
available.
