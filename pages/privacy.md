In general, we try to adhere to the guidelines of
[The Carpentries Privacy Policy](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/privacy.html).
We do not, however,
have the resources to maintain our own supporting infrastructure and rely on the free services
provided by third parties, for example, Google Forms and HackMD.

When it comes to reporting a suspected violation of the Privacy Policy, please know that this
is not intentional. We ask that you
report any violation to a member of the [HPC Carpentry Steering Committee](/contact#steering).
