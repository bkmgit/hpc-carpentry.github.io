Attending an [HPC Carpentry workshop]({% link pages/workshops.html %}) builds
the skills and perspectives to work more effectively and reproducibily with
high performance computing resources. You will build a skill set that will help
you understand queuing systems, write scripts to submit multiple jobs at once,
manage the file inputs and outputs for your jobs, and help you on the way to
doing robust, reproducible research, as well as the confidence to continue
learning.

We create a friendly environment for learning to empower researchers and enable
data driven discovery. All workshop participants are required to abide by
[our Code of Conduct](
/code-of-conduct/)
to ensure that all attendees to have a positive learning experience. Workshops
are currently designed for people with little to no prior computational
experience. Have a look at some [learner profiles]({% link pages/audience.html

others have found useful.

HPC Carpentry is a community effort, with several lessons under development
under our purview and many others outside our stewardship. There are currently
two avenues for community members to share lesson materials: 
[The Carpentries Incubator](
/community-lessons/#the-carpentries-incubator) and 
[HPC Carpentry Lab](/community-lessons/#hpc-carpentry-lab). These lessons can
be used by independent learners, taught at a workshop, or used as add-on
materials to an official Carpentries workshop that already includes the
[required lessons]( https://carpentries.org/workshops/#workshop-core).

We encourage anyone developing or considering giving a lesson to complete
[The Carpentries Instructor Training](
https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/instructor_training/index.html).
Find out more about The Carpentries approach to
teaching and hosting workshops in [The Carpentries Handbook](
