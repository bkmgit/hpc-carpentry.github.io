HPC Carpentry is a community effort. We meet 1200 UTC and 2200 UTC on the first
and third Thursday of every month to coordinate lesson development efforts,
share teaching experiences, and discuss feedback. We use a streamlined extract
of [Martha's Rules](https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/28)
for asynchronous decision-making. Matters requiring acute executive action are
addressed by our [Steering Committee](
https://github.com/hpc-carpentry/coordination/issues/36), which is also the
collective point of contact for The Carpentries proper.

Unless otherwise specified, the style, governance, and rules of HPC Carpentry
default to the [The Carpentries Bylaws](
https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/governance/bylaws.html).
