Around the world, HPC Carpentry workshops are organized by a team of Regional Coordinators.

<!--
<p>
Our core team Deputy Director of Workshops and Meetings, SherAaron Hurt,
manages workshops in most of the world. In some parts of the world, local
Carpenters support managing local workshops and building local communities.
They work as volunteers.
</p>

<p>
Regional Coordinators are the front face of HPC Carpentry, promoting our work
and our culture in their geographical area. They manage workshop logistics,
communicate with hosts and Instructors, and respond to general inquiries. The
Regional Coordinators work together to support each other and ensure
communities can thrive locally while maintaining quality and consistency
globally.
