HPC Carpentry is trying to help drive the community through the use of *Task Forces*
which can help enforce our Code of Conduct, resolve issues in lesson repositories,
build capacity in a range of ways and across different geographic regions, support
Instructors and their development, maintain our lessons, and more.
