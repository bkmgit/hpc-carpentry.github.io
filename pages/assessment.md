As scientists, engineers, and teachers, the HPC Carpentry community embraces
feedback and the opportunity to learn and improve delivery of our lesson
content. We lean on The Carpentries' robust survey infrastructure to assess our
learners backgrounds before, and outcomes following, each HPC Carpentry
workshop.

Assessment efforts]( https://carpentries.org/assessment/).
