We ask that people adhere to the guidelines of
[The Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).

When it comes to reporting a violation of that Code of Conduct at a workshop listed on our website, we ask that you
report the violation to a member of the [HPC Carpentry Steering Committee](/contact#steering).
