We are dedicated to providing a welcoming and supportive environment for all people, regardless of
background or identity.  In order to foster a positive and professional learning environment we
encourage the following practices:

* Use welcoming and inclusive language.
* Be respectful of different viewpoints and experiences.
* Gracefully accept constructive criticism.
* Focus on what is best for the community.
* Show courtesy and respect towards other community members.

Our community has chosen to adopt the official
[Carpentries Code of Conduct](https://docs.carpentries.org/topic_folders/policies/code-of-conduct.html).
If you have questions about the policy, concerns over observed behaviours, or need to report
a violation of the Code, we ask that you reach out to any member of the
[HPC Carpentry Steering Committee](/contact#steering). Your communications will be held in
confidence. We pledge to acknowledge your message within 24 hours, and to take action
within 30 calendar days.
