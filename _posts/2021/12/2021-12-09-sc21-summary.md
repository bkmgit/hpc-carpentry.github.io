## The BoF at SC21

The HPC Carpentry team hosted a "Birds of a Feather" session
at the [SC21][sc21] conference.  This was a hybrid conference,
and the BoF sessions were done via Zoom, with Q&A done via the
Sli.do tool.  Andrew Reid was on-site and hosted the on-site
portion from the podium, while Trevor Keller, Annajiat Alim
Rasel, Alan O'Cais, and Wirawan Purwanto were on-line,
monitoring the Zoom and Sli.do questions and keeping the
session flowing for all participants.

The primary purpose of this was to try to reconnect with the
HPC user community, and gather feedback and guidance on how to
prioritize our efforts moving forward. The BoF was a success
on all counts: 20 people attended in-person in St. Louis, and
40 people attended via Zoom, with good, sometimes vibrant
participation from both "factions" ðŸ˜‡ in the Q&A.

We imagine that the SC21 audience is probably somewhat more
performance- and hardware-aware than the Carpentries community
at large, and possibly also biased towards facility operators,
rather than novice users.  The feedback we gained is clearly
valuable;  nevertheless, we need to keep this intrinsic bias in
mind while we evaluate and act on this input.

There were a number of survey questions planned in advance,
which were presented via the polling functionality in the
Sli.do.  This information was captured and is available
in the [coordination repo][coordrepo].
The principal results are that attendees would like to see,
in descending order of preference:
Future lessons on containers;  Python and MPI;  Dask and
Julia;  Ability to mix and match lesson content;
Constructing half-day lessons that use the templating
capability to adapting lessons to permanent on-premise
facilities.

After the planned polling questions were done, a more general
discussion ensued, largely captured in a [CodiMD][bofcodi]
document.

A number of attendees were interested in how to give feedback
on their experience with the lessons, and seemed uncertain what
feedback we're looking for.  The answer is that we are mainly
looking for actionable feedbackÂ¹ that helps improve the lessons
for the community.  The main mechanism by which we imagine this
happening is through instructor and learner comments via poll
(to be written), Slack, and GitHub issues.  At the end of the
lesson, following usual Carpentries practice, organizers
should ask learners for positive and negative feedback, on
green or red sticky notes, and conduct a post-workshop survey.
This info, particularly the red stickies, is what we're
looking for, and ideally would be translated into issues on
the appropriate lesson repository.

We will be digesting the feedback received over the next few
weeks, and look forward to working through the generated
issues over the coming months to ensure our lessons benefit
from this excellent community participation.

### Highlights

- One way HPC Carpentry can add value, beyond the lessons
  themselves, is as a clearing house for HPC educational
  resources generally.
- The lessons and resources we choose to focus on are a
  signal to the community about our priorities, so we 
  should take some care in selecting these.
- MPI, implemented with low-level programming languages 
  (C, C++, Fortran), is still the most commonly-used framework 
  for parallel programming.  It's appropriate for 
  HPC Carpentry to develop lessons that focus on this 
  foundational material. 
- New users are increasingly unfamiliar with the command line
  and file system hierarchy. Extra instructional effort may be
  needed to help bridge this gap, including the effort of 
  developing GUI-focused lessons based on Open OnDemand 
  or JupyterHub.
- Some users still struggle with the difference in character
  between distributed and shared HPC resources, and more familiar
  laptop or workstation resources.  HPC is not just a big
  laptop.
- Interest in cloud-based HPC resources is surprisingly high, 
  driven by people with possibly-transient HPC workloads but without
  institutional HPC facilities.

1. "Actionable feedback" may seem flip, but we mean it
   sincerely: comments that include some tangible suggestion
   for improvement are tremendously helpful.
